# WebAppRestaurant
This app is created in React Native. At first, it has a login page that allows logging in or registering a new user. Once logged in, display a list of 10 random Restaurantâ€™s names. In order to leave a review, it has 1-5 stars and a text field. You can not leave just a written review or just a start rating. You have to write a review and also leave a star rating at the same time. Otherwise, an error message will prompt.

First I set up a new React Native Project.
The easiest way to get started is with Expo Go.
The most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes.

There is a possibility that you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them. But LET'S KEEP IT SIMPLE ;)

You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator.

Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app.

After you have installed Node.js, please install Expo CLI:
"npm install -g expo-cli" ; 

Now, teoretically, there would be no need to build another application, because we already have one. But some files could not be uploaded due to size, so we have to do a few steps before using this application:

1. Choose a place where you want to run this application or create a new folder an open it from the terminal, then run the following:
"npx create-expo-app RestaurantApp" ; 
"cd RestaurantApp" ; 

Now you will see a few files created which are mandatory for running an app, but we need just the "node_modules" folder, because those mandatory files are already here in the repository, so we want to avoid any conflict.

2. Please delete the the following files: "assets" folder, "App.js", "app.json", "babel.config.js", "package-lock.json", "package.json" 

3. Now download the files from this repository in ZIP format. After that, go to the downloaded folder, extract all files and open the extracted folder - "WebAppRestaurant-main". After that, you will see another folder with the same name - "WebAppRestaurant-main". Open it and now all needed files should be displayed. Please copy them all in the RestaurantApp folder. 

Now you have all the files which build the app, but this is not all you need. 
In order to be sure that it works, you have to install all the dependencies.

4. In order to be able to use TypeScript:
"npm install -D @tsconfig/react-native @types/jest @types/react @types/react-test-renderer typescript" ; 

5. Now, please run the following commands which are written between the quotation marks, one by one:

"npm install @react-navigation/native --force" ; 
"npm install @react-navigation/stack --force" ; 
"npm install @testing-library/react-native --force" ; 
"npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage --force" ; 
"npm install -g react-native-cli" ; 
"npm install firebase --force" ; 

Also, for the credentials used for Firebase, you need a Firebase account and also to add the application to the Firebase Authentication. Then in the firebase.js file, please put your api key etc

  apiKey: "AIzaSyBWgGBUPf6tr5F1xyf6o-rT8lWLezfVB54",
  authDomain: "mobileapp-56fc1.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "mobileapp-56fc1",
  storageBucket: "mobileapp-56fc1.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "569452177668",
  appId: "1:569452177668:web:f5e904e5ea2796c8b0c851",
  measurementId: "G-6GZR5522G8"

After installing all these dependencies, please go to the "api" folder using terminal commands like "cd folder_path" etc.
Please use a second terminal like CMD or POWERSHELL, because the terminal from VSCode is already in use and you will need it in order to run the application.

Now you will see some files which are used for the API creation, but in order to make it work, you will also have to install another dependencies, because of the size, those dependencies could not be uploaded here in the repository.
In the terminal, please run the following (supposing that you already have installed the Node.js):

"npm init -y" ; 
"npm install express" ; 

If you check, you will see the "node_modules" folder, which is mandatory. Now please run the following command:

"node server.js" ; 

You will see "Server is running on http://localhost:3000/api/random-restaurants". If you open the link, you will observe that the API is working. By refreshing the page, new data will be displayed.

In order to be able to use Redux for state management, you will have to install it by running the following commands in the VSCode terminal (make sure you are located in the root folder of the RestaurantApp):

"npm install redux react-redux" ; 
"npm install @reduxjs/toolkit" ; 


Now that the dependencies are installed and the API server is running, let's run the application. Go back to the VSCode terminal and make sure that you are in the RestaurantApp folder. After that, please run the following command:

"npx expo start" ; 

Enjoy ;)
